### Form 3 Novel- How I Met Myself

It's such an overdue post, PMR has just passed and here I am posting this long awaited entry on the Form 3 novel, How I Met Myself. This novel is all about finding your own ghost or *doppelganger* and answers the questions of "What If" and "If Only". I've found out that this novel is an interesting piece of literature as it questions the pasts and brings back the future, and it will definitely serves as a medium of intellectual discussions among students and teachers. By the time students reach the Third Form, I realize that students need to be stimulated and encouraged to participate well in group and class discussions as some students fail to give responses due to lack of stimulating readings and low self esteem. The idea now in Malaysia, is to let students take charge of the whole learning process, encourage them to think critically  and creatively and teachers should take a back seat. Many times, teachers are deemed to be responsible on students' learning process but the reality is students should be held responsible for their own learning as well.

In this entry, I'm sharing with you, some useful notes on this Form Three novel.
